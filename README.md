# TournamentMaker
Tournament maker is a website designed for creating League of Legends teams and tournaments. It's created by [Thom](https://github.com/lantaarnappel "Thom") and [Nico](https://github.com/koffielyder "Nico"), with help from Simon.

Tournament maker is currently in alpha, and hosted ](http://tournament.hosting "here"). Please keep in mind that the website is in alpha, and the database can be reset at any time. We do not recommend you use the website for anything serious right now.

We expect the website to be usable for tournaments in anything from 2 weeks to 2 months.

The program is created in Laravel together with Bootstrap.
